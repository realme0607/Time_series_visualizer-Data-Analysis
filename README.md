📈  Time Series Visualizer
This project analyzes and visualizes the daily page views of the freeCodeCamp.org forum using time series data. The goal is to identify trends, seasonality, and long-term growth patterns in forum traffic between May 2016 and December 2019.

📊 Visualizations Generated
The project generates three distinct types of plots to analyze the data:

Line Chart (line_plot.png): Shows the raw daily page view data over the entire time period, highlighting the overall trend.

Bar Chart (bar_plot.png): Displays the average daily page views grouped by month and year, illustrating year-over-year growth for specific months.

Box Plots (box_plot.png): Presents two side-by-side box plots to analyze the distribution of page views:

Year-wise Box Plot (Trend): Shows how the median and spread of views have changed annually.

Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality): Reveals recurring monthly patterns in traffic.

🚀 Setup and Installation
To run this project locally, you need Python and the necessary data science libraries.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

The data file: fcc-forum-pageviews.csv (This file must be present in the project's root directory).

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Running the Code
The core logic is contained within time_series_visualizer.py. Executing this script will perform the data cleaning and generate the three required image files.

Bash

python time_series_visualizer.py
After running the command, three .png image files will be saved in the root directory:

line_plot.png

bar_plot.png

box_plot.png

🧹 Data Cleaning Methodology
Before generating the visualizations, the data is cleaned to filter out statistical noise and outliers:

The data is cleaned by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or the bottom 2.5% of the dataset.

This ensures the visualizations accurately represent typical trends rather than extreme, potentially anomalous events.
